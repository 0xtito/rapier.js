### v0.1.17
- Fix bug when ghost forces and/or crashes could be observed when a kinematic body touches a static body.

### v0.1.16
- Fix kinematic rigid-body not waking up dynamic bodies it touches.
- Added `new Ray(origin, direction)` constructor instead of `Ray.new(origin, direction)`.

### v0.1.15
- Fix crash when removing a kinematic rigid-body from the World.

### v0.1.14
- Fix issues where force application functions took ownership of the JS vector, preventing the user from
  freeing with `Vector.free()` afterwards.

### v0.1.13
- Added `rigidBody.setNextKinematicTranslation` to set the translation of a kinematic rigid-body at the next timestep.
- Added `rigidBody.setNextKinematicRotation` to set the rotation of a kinematic rigid-body at the next timestep.
- Added `rigidBody.predictedTranslation` to get the translation of a kinematic rigid-body at the next timestep.
- Added `rigidBody.predictedRotation` to set the rotation of a kinematic rigid-body at the next timestep.
- Added `Ray` and `RayIntersection` structures for ray-casting.
- Added `world.castRay` to compute the first hit of a ray with the physics scene.
- Fix a bug causing a kinematic rigid-body not to teleport as expected after a `rigidBody.setPosition`.

### v0.1.12
- Added `world.removeCollider(collider)` to remove a collider from the physics world.
- Added `colliderDesc.setTranslation(...)` to set the relative translation of the collider to build wrt.
  the rigid-body it is attached to.
- Added `colliderDesc.setRotation(...)` to set the relative rotation of the collider to build wrt.
  the rigid-body it is attached to.

### v0.1.11
- Fix a bug causing a crash when the broad-phase proxy handles were recycled.

### v0.1.10
- Fix a determinism problem that could cause rigid-body handle allocation to be non-deterministic after a snapshot
  restoration.

### v0.1.9
- Added `world.getCollider(handle)` that retrieves a collider from its integer handle.
- Added `joint.handle()` that returns the integer handle of the joint.


### v0.1.8
- Added `world.forEachRigidBodyHandle(f)` to apply a closure on the integer handle
  of each rigid-body on the world.
- Added `world.forEachActiveRigidBody(f)` to apply a closure on each rigid-body
  on the world.
- Added `world.forEachActiveRigidBodyHandle(f)` to apply a closure on the integer
  handle of each rigid-body on the world.
- Added `rigidBody.applyForce`, `.applyTorque`, `.applyImpulse`, `.applyTorqueImpulse`, `.applyForceAtPoint`, and
  `.applyImpulseAtPoint` to apply a manual force or torque to a rigid-body.
- Added the `EventQueue` structure that can be used to collect and iterate through physics events.
- Added the `Proximity` enum that represents the proximity state of a sensor collider and another collider.
- Added the `world.stepWithEvents(eventQueue)` which executes a physics timestep and collects the physics events
  into the given event queue.

### v0.1.7
- Added `world.getRigidBody(handle)` to retrieve a rigid-body from its handle.
- Added `world.getJoint(handle)` to retrieve a joint from its handle.
- Added `rigidBody.rotation()` to retrieve its world-space orientation as a quaternion.
- Added `rigidBody.setTranslation(...)` to set the translation of a rigid-body.
- Added `rigidBody.setRotation(...)` to set the orientation of a rigid-body.
- Added `rigidBody.wakeUp()` to manually wake up a rigid-body.
- Added `rigidBody_desc.setRotation(...)` to set tho orientation of the rigid-body to be created.

### v0.1.6
- Added `world.removeRigidBody(...)` to remove a rigid-body from the world.
